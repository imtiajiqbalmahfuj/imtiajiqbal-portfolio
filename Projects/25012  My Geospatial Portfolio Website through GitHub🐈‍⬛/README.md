After an intense week of dedication and exploration, I have successfully built and launched my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted through GitHub Pages. 🌐

This has been an incredibly rewarding journey. Previously, I had created a portfolio website through my UI/UX design skills using drag and drop tools in Framer. While it was sleek and flexible with its CMS features, I soon realized the limitations—mainly high costs for a custom domain and hosting, as well as restricted flexibility in design and functionality.

So, I decided to take the challenge head-on. For seven days straight, I spent over 18 hours a day diving into coding—experimenting, failing, learning, and rebuilding. With the help of AI (hashtag#vibe_coding) and continuous practice, I was able to translate my ideas into a fully functional, self-coded website.

What I learned during this process is that coding isn’t just about syntax or rules today—it’s about vibing with the code, understanding its logic, and feeling connected to what you’re creating. Once you catch that rhythm, it becomes exciting.

Now, it's time to take a nap 🫩😴  

💡 A little disclaimer: this project demanded immense effort, sleepless nights, and countless debugging sessions. So if you’re interested in getting help building your own, I’d love to collaborate—but let’s keep it meaningful, with fair discussions and negotiations.
