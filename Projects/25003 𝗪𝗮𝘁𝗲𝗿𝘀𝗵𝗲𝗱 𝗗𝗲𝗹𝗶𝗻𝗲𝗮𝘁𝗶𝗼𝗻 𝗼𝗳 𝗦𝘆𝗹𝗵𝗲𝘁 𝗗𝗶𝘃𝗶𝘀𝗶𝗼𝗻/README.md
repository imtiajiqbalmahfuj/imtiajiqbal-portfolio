## 📝 Overview
Sylhet Division, known for its vulnerability to flash floods, recently experienced severe flooding. To understand the hydrological dynamics, I created a watershed delineation map using ASTER DEM from NASA Earthdata. 

The workflow involved:
 ✅ DEM Processing: Fill, Flow Direction, Flow Accumulation
 ✅ River Network Identification: Extracted rivers from the flow accumulation raster
 ✅ Catchment & Subcatchment Delineation: Created watershed boundaries to visualize water flow

This map provides insights into how water moves during normal conditions and how flow increases during flash floods. This will serve as a foundation for further analysis on flood risk assessment and mitigation planning using GIS and remote sensing techniques.
