## 📝 Overview
Excited to share my latest project—creating a 3D elevation map to visualize the elevation and river flow of Durunish using ArcGIS Pro. 

This visualization uses red shades for elevated areas and green for lower surfaces, offering a clear and intuitive representation of terrain variations. The elevation data was sourced from NASA, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

3D mapping provides a powerful tool for urban planners, GIS & RS specialists, and researchers, making it easier to analyze complex data and derive insights about terrain and hydrology. 

A big shoutout to GeoDelta Labs for his excellent tutorial that guided me through the process.
