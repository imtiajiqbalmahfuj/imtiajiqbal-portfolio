## 📝 Overview
A few weeks ago, I took my first deep dive into Google Earth Engine (GEE) and explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of nighttime light pollution (NLP) in Dhaka from 2015 to 2023. Using VIIRS Nighttime Lights data, I analyzed how urban expansion, infrastructural growth, and industrial activities have influenced NLP over the years. (At first I tried it on Munshiganj, but for some reason it didn't work.)

###🔍 Key Insights:
📈 Dhaka's nighttime light intensity increased from an average radiance of 3.55 nW/cm²/sr in 2015 to 4.72 nW/cm²/sr in 2023, highlighting rapid urbanization and industrialization.
🌆 The central metropolitan area remains the most illuminated, significantly contributing to light pollution.
🛰️ Google Earth Engine (GEE) enabled efficient data processing, visualization, and time-series analysis.
