## 📝 Overview
In this bivariate map, I explored data from the 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐇𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟕, combining 𝐆𝐃𝐏 𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐚 with the 𝐇𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞 to see how closely income and joy walk hand in hand around the world.



Some countries show that wealth and happiness grow together. But others tell a different story, where economic success doesn’t always bring emotional or social well-being. And then there are nations with modest income levels where people still report high happiness. 



🗺️ This bivariate map doesn’t give one answer, but invites many questions.

➡️ What patterns do you see?

➡️ Where does your country stand—and does it reflect your lived experience?

➡️ What do you think truly drives happiness, if not just income?

💬 I'm curious—what do you think?
