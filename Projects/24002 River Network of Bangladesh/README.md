## 📝 Overview
Rivers are the lifeblood of ecosystems, economies, and communities 🌊

I’m excited to share a detailed map of the river network of Bangladesh that I created using ArcGIS Pro and Blender. 

This project has been a labor of love, aimed at highlighting the intricate and vital river systems that shape our country’s landscape. 

A big thanks to Tabib for his invaluable help in making this vision a reality. & Thank you Ali Abdallah for the tutorial.
