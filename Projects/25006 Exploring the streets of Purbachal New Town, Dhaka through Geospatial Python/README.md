## 📝 Overview
Mapped the road types of 𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑒𝑤 𝑇𝑜𝑤𝑛, 𝐷ℎ𝑎𝑘𝑎 using Python — combining 𝐨𝐬𝐦𝐧𝐱, 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐲, and 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐛 to visualize the urban layout with customized color coding (𝐜𝐦𝐚𝐩).

The map distinguishes between 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥, 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐬, offering a clear picture of the area's road hierarchy. While analyzing the map, I found that Purbachal New Town has been designed with a 𝐠𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐢𝐫𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 — a structured urban design model known for promoting organized growth, efficient transportation, and better land management.

This project opened up a lot of curiosity for me about Purbachal’s urban planning, and I’m looking forward to exploring its spatial and infrastructural dynamics even further!

Special thanks to Emmanuel Yerbo for sharing the coding framework and inspiring this exploration. Grateful for the support!
