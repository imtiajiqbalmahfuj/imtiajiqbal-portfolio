## 📝 Overview
Evapotranspiration plays a critical role in the water cycle, combining both evaporation from the soil and transpiration from plants. 

Understanding ETo is essential for drought mitigation, agriculture, hydrology, and environmental management. 

Here's a map I created showcasing the mean Evapotranspiration (ETo) across Bangladesh using ArcGIS Pro with IDW interpolation method. This type of maps can be a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and planners working towards sustainable resource management in Bangladesh.
