## 📝 Overview
This project visualizes **global earthquake fatalities** from 2000 to 2020 using **QGIS**, marking my first experience working with this powerful open-source GIS platform. The goal was to transform raw global earthquake data into an insightful spatial representation of **earthquake intensity and human impact**.  

Earthquakes have caused significant human and infrastructural losses over the past decades. By spatially analyzing where **death tolls were highest**, this map helps identify global hotspots that require urgent disaster management and preparedness planning.  

The visualization highlights both **high-impact regions (e.g., Asia-Pacific, South America)** and **moderate zones**, providing an intuitive understanding of **spatial distribution patterns** of natural disasters.  

This project aims to serve researchers, urban planners, and policymakers in improving **disaster resilience** and **risk reduction strategies** through spatial insights.

## ⚙️ Methodology
| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Data Collection | Global earthquake data from 2000–2020 (sourced from USGS / Global Earthquake Database) |
| 2. Preprocessing | Data cleaning and attribute filtering in QGIS |
| 3. Analysis | Visual classification based on **number of deaths** per event |
| 4. Visualization | Symbolized intensity using graduated color ramp (magenta = higher death toll) with basemap context |

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- 🔹 Identified **Asia-Pacific** and **South American** regions as major earthquake hotspots.  
- 🔹 Visualized **death intensity distribution** across decades.  
- 🔹 Demonstrated how **QGIS** can effectively map and analyze large geospatial datasets.
