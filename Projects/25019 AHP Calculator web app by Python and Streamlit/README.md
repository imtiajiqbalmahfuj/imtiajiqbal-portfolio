## üìù Overview
Suppose you are selecting the best partner to get married. The factors might include: knowledge, character/personality/values, beauty, and religion. Then which partner will be the best fit for you? Here comes MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). And one of the most famous techniques of MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) is AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). 

The **Advanced AHP Calculator** is an interactive Python web application built using **Streamlit**.  
It allows users to **learn the Analytic Hierarchy Process** while performing real-time calculations for any multi-criteria decision-making problem.  

This app is designed for **beginners and professionals alike**, explaining:  
- Saaty's 1‚Äì9 scale and how to assign pairwise comparisons  
- Matrix normalization and calculation of priority vectors  
- Consistency check using the Consistency Ratio (CR)  
- Synthesis of final global priorities to rank alternatives  

The app also provides **visualizations, step-by-step explanations, and formulas** so users can **fully understand AHP**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. **Input Criteria** | Enter all the decision criteria (e.g., Cost, Quality, Time). Each criterion represents a factor affecting the decision. |
| 2. **Input Alternatives** | Enter all alternatives (e.g., Supplier A, Supplier B). Each alternative is a possible option to choose from. |
| 3. **Pairwise Comparisons** | Compare each pair of criteria using **Saaty's 1‚Äì9 scale**. Repeat for alternatives under each criterion. |
| 4. **Normalize Matrix & Calculate Priority Vector** | Divide each element by its column sum to normalize the matrix. Then, calculate the priority vector (average of rows) to find local weights. |
| 5. **Consistency Check** | Compute Œª_max, Consistency Index (CI), and Consistency Ratio (CR) to verify the reliability of the comparisons. CR ‚â§ 0.1 is acceptable. |
| 6. **Synthesize Global Priorities** | Multiply each alternative‚Äôs local weights by the corresponding criteria weights and sum across all criteria to get final scores. |
| 7. **Visualize & Rank Alternatives** | Display final rankings and bar charts for easy interpretation. |

## üìä Example Use Case
**Decision Problem:** Selecting the best supplier based on three criteria: Cost, Quality, Time.  

- Criteria: Cost, Quality, Time  
- Alternatives: Supplier A, Supplier B, Supplier C  

**Steps:**  
1. Enter criteria and alternatives  
2. Fill pairwise comparisons using the 1‚Äì9 scale  
3. Review normalized matrices and priority vectors  
4. Check CR for consistency  
5. See final global priorities and ranking
